#summary Dyniso Introduction.

= Introduction =

Dyniso solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a box
with the intent of simulating the decay of homogeneous, isotropic 
turbulence.

== Building Dyniso ==

Assuming a Linux system with the GCC compilers in your path
and a threaded FFTW 2.1.5 available at:  
{{{$(HOME)/local/fftw-thread}}}
simply do:
{{{
cd src
make opt
}}}
== Running Dyniso ==
{{{
./dyniso.exe < test.inp
}}}
to select the number of OpenMP threads, do:
{{{
env OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./dyniso.exe < test.inp
}}}
The code will output a number of files including:

 # Time statistics in stat?.dat
 # Spectra at selected timesteps in spectra.`*`
 # Plot3d visualization files in out.{xyz,q}

== Notes ==
 # The Plot3d files are in fortran unformated (not C-binary)
 # On MacOS-X (Darwin), you need to install a version of gfortran.
   I use the version from MacPorts which you can select using
{{{
   sudo port select --set gcc gcc46
}}}
   and you return to the original Apple compilers using
{{{
   sudo port select --set gcc none
}}}
