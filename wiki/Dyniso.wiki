#summary Dyniso Introduction.

= Introduction to Dyniso =

Dyniso solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a box
with the intent of simulating the decay of homogeneous, isotropic 
turbulence.

== Building Dyniso ==

Assuming a Linux or Darwin (MacOS-X) system with the GCC compilers in your path and a threaded FFTW 2.1.5 available at:  
{{{$(HOME)/local/fftw-omp}}}
simply do:
{{{
cd src
make opt
}}}

Note:  FFTW v2 is *not* required to run Dyniso as several system-supplied FFT libraries are also supported.

== Running Dyniso ==
{{{
./dyniso.exe < test.inp
}}}
to select the number of OpenMP threads, do:
{{{
env OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./dyniso.exe < test.inp
}}}
The code will output a number of files including:

 # Time statistics in stat?.dat
 # Spectra at selected timesteps in spectra.`*`
 # Plot3d visualization files in out.{xyz,q}

== Notes ==
 # The Plot3d files are in Fortran unformatted (not C-binary)
 # On MacOS-X (Darwin), you need to install a version of gfortran.  I use the version from [http://www.macports.org MacPorts] which you can select using
{{{
sudo port select --set gcc gcc46
}}}
 and you return to the original Apple compilers using
{{{
sudo port select --set gcc none
}}}

== Examples ==

Contours of velocity magnitude from Dyniso on a 384^3^ mesh (with dealiasing this is really a 576^3^ mesh), computed using 8 threads on an Apple `MacBook` Pro with Intel Corei7 processors.  Visualized using the Plot3d reader in [http://www.paraview.org/ Paraview].
